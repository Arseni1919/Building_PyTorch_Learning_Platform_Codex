# PyTorch Mastery Course (created by Codex of OpenAI)

Become fluent in PyTorch through a structured, hands-on journey that moves from foundational concepts to state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The course follows a top-down, project-friendly approach so you always see the big picture before diving into details.

> **Note:** Network access is restricted in this environment, so all guidance reflects best practices and APIs current through October 2024. Refer to the linked official PyTorch docs for the latest updates.

## How to Use This Course
- Work through the notebooks in order; each topic builds on prior material and includes quick references to earlier lessons.
- Every notebook mixes conceptual overviews, annotated code labs, visual explanations, and mini coding tasks.
- Solutions live in hidden cells tagged as `solution`. In JupyterLab, enable *View → Cell Toolbar → Tags* or the *Hide Input* extension to reveal them after attempting each exercise.
- Each notebook ends with a comprehensive exercise tying together the lesson’s skills. Treat these as mini-projects to cement understanding.
- Use the “Further Reading” sections to dive deeper into official docs, papers, and community resources.

## Prerequisites
- Comfortable with core Python, NumPy, and basic linear algebra
- A working PyTorch installation (`>=2.2`)
- Recommended tooling: JupyterLab or VS Code’s notebook interface, GPU access for intermediate/advanced labs

PyTorch Mastery Course

I want to become fluent in PyTorch through hands-on experience. Please create a comprehensive, practical course that takes me from beginner to advanced level with real coding exercises.

Core Requirements

Create a well-organized README.md with course content divided into 3 levels: Beginner (around 5 topics) covering fundamentals and basic concepts, Intermediate (around 5 topics) focusing on core deep learning implementations, and Advanced/Professional (around 5 topics) covering state-of-the-art techniques.

IN addition to other topics, the course must include these topics: attention mechanisms including multi-head, self-attention, and cross-attention, transformers architecture with encoder-decoder and positional encoding, Flash Attention optimization, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and a comprehensive guide to different loss functions explaining when to use each type.

Notebook Requirements

For each topic, create a separate Jupyter notebook that describes concepts in simple, accessible terms. Use a top-down approach by starting with big picture concepts first, then diving deep into implementation details. Apply a step-by-step approach where for each concept like attention, you describe every step, explain why it's needed, why it's important, and why it cannot be skipped. Always explain interconnections between topics, connecting new concepts to the bigger picture and showing relationships between different areas. Use search to verify the latest information on every topic to ensure accuracy and current best practices.

Include visualizations where helpful using matplotlib or similar tools. Use diagrams to explain complex concepts and show data flow and model architecture visually. Provide simple, real-world use cases and include code snippets with expected outputs written as comments. Follow Python best practices and use only standard libraries like PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc. to keep code simple and understandable.

Create mini coding tasks after significant learning chunks and include a comprehensive exercise at the end of each notebook. Use collapsible or hidden cells for solutions so users can attempt problems before seeing answers. Provide step-by-step guidance for complex implementations.

Learning Objectives and Style

By the end of this course, I should be able to implement any PyTorch concept from scratch, understand when and why to use different techniques, build modern deep learning architectures independently, and debug and optimize PyTorch models effectively.

Maintain a professional but approachable tone that is not overly verbose but also not too short in explanations. Write clean, well-commented, production-ready code examples. Research and verify the latest PyTorch best practices and APIs before writing each section. Ensure beginners can follow along while providing sufficient depth for advanced users.

Teaching Methodology

Always start with the conceptual overview before diving into code implementation using a top-down learning approach. Break down complex topics into digestible steps with clear reasoning for each step. Continuously connect new topics to previously learned concepts and show how everything fits together in the deep learning ecosystem. Verify and include the most up-to-date information and best practices for each topic.

Start with a comprehensive topic list covering all essential PyTorch areas and ensure smooth progression between difficulty levels. Include practical tips and common pitfalls to avoid. Provide resources for further learning after each topic. Make the course self-contained while referencing official documentation when appropriate.

The goal is to create a course that transforms a PyTorch beginner into someone who can confidently implement and explain any deep learning concept using PyTorch from first principles.
